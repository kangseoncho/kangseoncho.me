        I'm a software engineer deeply interested in working with all aspects of the Web,
        from front-end to back-end, and a passion for making the Internet accessible to anyone and everyone. <br/>

        Recent project was ExpressiveJS. Also gave a talk at SoCal React x Node meetup regarding child processes in Node. <br/>

        When I can, I love converting old-fashioned items such as diaries and canvases into web applications
        using React, PostGreSQL, Express, or whatever technologies suit the project's needs.
